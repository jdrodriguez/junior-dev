# The Junior Developer Guidebook

> An A-to-Z guide to building modern web apps with AI, written by a dad for his son. Covers the complete journey from zero to deploying real full-stack applications using Claude Code, Next.js, React, Supabase, Hono, and TypeScript. Focuses on conceptual understanding over memorization, using analogies, embedded videos, and practical prompts for AI-assisted development ("vibe coding").

The guidebook is structured as 10 sequential chapters, each building on the last. It teaches web development fundamentals through a "vibe coding" philosophy — understanding concepts well enough to direct AI tools like Claude Code, rather than memorizing syntax. The tech stack covered is Next.js (React), Supabase (PostgreSQL), Hono (API framework), and TypeScript.

## Core Chapters

- [Introduction](/introduction/): Welcome, tech stack overview, and the "Chef and Kitchen Robot" analogy for AI-assisted development
- [Dev Environment](/01-dev-environment/): Setting up VS Code, terminal, Node.js, Git, and Claude Code
- [How the Web Works](/02-how-the-web-works/): Client-server model, HTTP, HTML/CSS/JS, JSON, and APIs
- [JavaScript & TypeScript](/03-javascript-typescript/): Core JS concepts (variables, functions, arrays, objects), TypeScript types, and async/await
- [Git & GitHub](/04-git-and-github/): Version control concepts, daily workflow, branching, commits, .gitignore, and recovery
- [React & Next.js](/05-react-nextjs/): Components, props, state, hooks, file-based routing, and Tailwind CSS
- [Databases & Supabase](/06-databases-supabase/): Database fundamentals, Supabase setup, migrations, querying in code, and Row Level Security
- [APIs with Hono](/07-apis-with-hono/): REST API basics, routes, parameters, middleware, and error handling
- [Claude Code](/08-claude-code/): Getting started, capabilities, writing effective prompts, CLAUDE.md files, and advanced patterns
- [Deployment](/09-deployment/): Hosting platforms, deploying to Vercel, and environment variables
- [Developer Mindset](/10-developer-mindset/): Debugging strategies, learning approaches, project ideas, and resources

## Key Concepts

- [JavaScript Foundations](/03-javascript-typescript/01-javascript-foundations/): Variables as labeled boxes, functions as recipes, arrays as numbered lists, objects as contact cards
- [TypeScript](/03-javascript-typescript/02-typescript/): Types as spell-check for code, interfaces as blueprints, type inference
- [Async/Await](/03-javascript-typescript/03-async-await/): The food delivery analogy, try/catch as safety nets
- [React Components](/05-react-nextjs/01-components/): Components as LEGO bricks, props as settings, composition patterns
- [The CLAUDE.md File](/08-claude-code/04-claude-md/): Giving Claude Code permanent project memory, conventions, and rules
- [Writing Prompts for Claude Code](/08-claude-code/03-writing-prompts/): Effective prompt patterns for AI-assisted development

## Optional

- [Git Recovery](/04-git-and-github/06-recovery/): How to undo mistakes in Git
- [.gitignore](/04-git-and-github/05-gitignore/): Which files to exclude from version control
- [Environment Variables](/09-deployment/03-env-variables/): Managing secrets and configuration
- [Project Ideas](/10-developer-mindset/03-project-ideas/): Starter project suggestions for practice
- [Resources](/10-developer-mindset/04-resources/): Curated learning resources and communities
