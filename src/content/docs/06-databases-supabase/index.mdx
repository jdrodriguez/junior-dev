Every app you have built so far loses its data the moment you refresh the page. That is about to change. In this chapter, you are going to learn how to store data permanently in a real database -- and Supabase is going to make it surprisingly easy.

Supabase is your backend-in-a-box. It gives you a PostgreSQL database, user authentication, file storage, and real-time subscriptions. Instead of spending weeks setting up servers and databases from scratch, you get all of it with a few clicks and a free account.

<Analogy title="Supabase Is a Furnished Apartment">
Building a backend from scratch is like building a house. You need to pour the foundation, frame the walls, run the plumbing, wire the electricity -- all before you can even move in. Supabase is like renting a furnished apartment. The structure is there, the utilities work, and you can start living in it on day one. You still need to arrange the furniture (your data tables) the way you want, but the hard stuff is handled.

Databases are one of the most important skills in all of software development. Almost every app you will ever build -- whether it is a to-do list, a social media platform, or a billion-dollar business -- has a database at its core. The concepts you learn in this chapter will follow you for your entire career. Take your time with this one.
