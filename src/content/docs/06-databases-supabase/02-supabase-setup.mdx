Time to set up your first real backend. Supabase gives you a full PostgreSQL database, authentication, and more -- all from a free account. By the end of this section, your Next.js app will be connected to a real database.

## Create Your Supabase Project

<Steps>

1. **Sign up at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).**
   Create a free account. You can sign in with GitHub, which makes life easier.

2. **Create a new project.**
   Click "New Project." Choose a name for it (something like `my-first-app`). Set a strong database password -- write it down somewhere safe, you will need it later. Pick a region close to where you live for faster performance.

3. **Wait for it to spin up.**
   Supabase takes about a minute to create your project. Grab a snack.

4. **Copy your API credentials.**
   Once your project is ready, go to **Settings > API**. You need two values:
   - **Project URL** -- looks like `https://abcdefghij.supabase.co`
   - **Anon key** -- a long string of characters

5. **Add credentials to your project.**
   In your Next.js project, create a file called `.env.local` in the root folder:

   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
   ```

6. **Install the Supabase client library.**

   ```bash
   npm install @supabase/supabase-js
   ```

</Steps>

That is it. Your project now has a real database behind it.

<DadTip>
The `.env.local` file is where you store secrets -- API keys, passwords, configuration that should never be pushed to GitHub. Your `.gitignore` file should already exclude it. If it does not, add `.env.local` to your `.gitignore` immediately. Leaking API keys on GitHub is one of the most common beginner mistakes, and it can cost real money if someone finds them.
</DadTip>

## Understanding the Anon Key

The anon key is not exactly a secret -- it is designed to be used in the browser. But it is not a free pass either. By itself, the anon key gives very limited access to your database. The real security comes from **Row Level Security (RLS)**, which we will set up later in this chapter. Think of the anon key as your front door key -- it gets you into the building, but each apartment still has its own lock.

## The Supabase Dashboard

Take a few minutes to explore the Supabase dashboard. Here are the tabs you will use most:

- **Table Editor** -- A visual spreadsheet-like view of your data. Great for poking around.
- **SQL Editor** -- Write and run SQL queries directly. Very useful for testing.
- **Authentication** -- Manage users, sign-up settings, and login providers.
- **Settings > API** -- Where your keys live.

## What to Tell Claude Code

<PromptExample
  prompt="Set up Supabase in my Next.js project. Create a Supabase client utility file that I can import anywhere."
  context="You have already created a Supabase project and added your keys to .env.local."
  result="Claude Code creates a utility file (like lib/supabase.ts) that initializes the Supabase client using your environment variables, so you can import it from any page or component."
/>

<ProgressChecklist
  id="ch6-supabase-setup"
  items={[
    "I created a Supabase account and project",
    "I copied my Project URL and anon key into .env.local",
    "I installed @supabase/supabase-js",
    "I understand what the anon key does (and does not do)",
    "I explored the Supabase dashboard"
  ]}
/>
