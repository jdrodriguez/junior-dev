A database is where your app's data lives permanently. When a user creates an account, writes a post, or saves their settings -- all of that goes into a database. Without one, your app has amnesia. It forgets everything the second someone closes the browser.

## What Is a Database?

<Analogy title="A Database Is a Spreadsheet on Steroids">
You have used Google Sheets before. A database is the same basic idea -- data organized into rows and columns -- but built to handle millions of rows, multiple users reading and writing at the same time, and rules that keep the data clean and consistent. Think of it as a spreadsheet that went to the gym and got a computer science degree.
</Analogy>

A PostgreSQL database (the kind Supabase gives you) is organized into three things:

- **Tables** are like individual sheets in a spreadsheet. You might have a `users` table, a `posts` table, and a `comments` table.
- **Rows** are like spreadsheet rows. Each row is one record -- one user, one post, one comment.
- **Columns** are like spreadsheet columns. Each column is one piece of information -- a name, an email, a timestamp.

## SQL: Talking to Your Database

SQL (Structured Query Language) is the language you use to communicate with a database. It has been around since the 1970s and it is not going anywhere. Here are the four essential operations, known as **CRUD**:

### Create (INSERT)

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, email)
VALUES ('Marcus', 'marcus@email.com');
```

This adds a new row to the `users` table.

### Read (SELECT)

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'marcus@email.com';
```

This asks the database to find and return every column for the user with that email.

### Update (UPDATE)

```sql
UPDATE users SET name = 'Marcus Jr.' WHERE email = 'marcus@email.com';
```

This changes the name for a specific user.

### Delete (DELETE)

```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE email = 'marcus@email.com';
```

This removes a row. In real-world applications, we usually do "soft deletes" instead -- marking a row as deleted without actually removing it -- so we can undo mistakes. More on that later.

<DadTip>
You do not need to memorize SQL right now. When you are vibe coding, Claude Code will write the SQL for you. But you need to *understand* what it is doing. If Claude generates a `SELECT` query, you should know it is reading data. If it generates an `INSERT`, you should know it is creating data. That understanding is what lets you catch mistakes before they hit production.
</DadTip>

## Creating a Table

Here is what it looks like to create a table from scratch:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);
```

Let's break that down:

- `id UUID PRIMARY KEY` -- Every row gets a unique identifier. Think of it like a social security number for that row.
- `DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()` -- The database generates the ID automatically.
- `TEXT NOT NULL` -- This column holds text and cannot be left empty.
- `UNIQUE` -- No two rows can have the same value in this column.
- `TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()` -- Automatically records when the row was created.
