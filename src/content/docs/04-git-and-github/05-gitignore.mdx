Not everything in your project folder should be tracked by Git. Some files are huge and easily recreated (like `node_modules/`). Some files contain passwords and API keys that would be catastrophic to share publicly. The `.gitignore` file is a simple text file that tells Git: "Pretend these files do not exist."

Every single project you create should have a `.gitignore` file, and it should be one of the very first things you set up -- ideally before your first commit.

<Analogy title="The Bouncer's Guest List">
Think of `.gitignore` like the bouncer at the door of your Git repository. You give the bouncer a list of names (file patterns) and say "do not let these in." When you run `git add .`, Git checks the list and skips anything that matches. The files still exist on your computer -- they just do not get tracked or uploaded.

## What Should You Ignore?

Here is the standard `.gitignore` for the kind of projects we build in this book (Next.js, Node.js, Supabase):

```gitignore
# Dependencies - huge folder, easily reinstalled with npm install
node_modules/

# Environment variables - CONTAINS YOUR SECRETS
.env
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local

# Build output - generated files, not source code
.next/
dist/
out/
build/

# System files - OS junk that nobody needs
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Editor files
.vscode/settings.json
*.swp
*.swo

# Debug logs
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*

# Turbo cache
.turbo

# Vercel
.vercel
```

## The .env Rule

:::danger[NEVER Commit .env Files]
Your `.env` files contain API keys, database passwords, and other secrets. If you push them to GitHub -- even to a private repository -- consider those secrets **compromised**. Bots scan GitHub constantly looking for accidentally committed credentials.

If you accidentally commit a secret:
1. **Immediately** rotate (change) the key or password
2. Remove the file from Git tracking: `git rm --cached .env`
3. Make sure `.env` is in your `.gitignore`
4. Commit and push the fix

The old secret is still in your Git history, which is why you must rotate it. Deleting the file from the current commit does not erase it from past commits.
:::

This is not hypothetical. Real companies have had major security breaches because someone committed an AWS key to a public repo. It takes automated bots less than a minute to find and exploit leaked credentials.

<DadTip>
Before your very first commit on any project, check two things: (1) Is there a `.gitignore` file? (2) Does it include `.env`? Make this a reflex. I actually set up the `.gitignore` before I write a single line of code. It is that important.
</DadTip>

## Why Ignore `node_modules/`?

Your `node_modules/` folder can contain hundreds of thousands of files and be hundreds of megabytes. It is entirely recreated when someone runs `npm install`, so there is zero reason to track it in Git. Committing it would make your repository massive, slow to clone, and impossible to review.

## Creating a .gitignore

The simplest way: create the file yourself in your project root.

```bash
# In your project root
touch .gitignore
```

Then paste the template from above. Or even better -- let AI do it:

<PromptExample
  prompt="Create a .gitignore file for a Next.js project with Supabase and Tailwind CSS"
  context="When starting a new project before your first commit"
  result="Claude will generate a comprehensive .gitignore covering node_modules, .env files, build output, OS files, and framework-specific directories"
/>

:::tip
GitHub offers a collection of `.gitignore` templates at [github.com/github/gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore). The `Node.gitignore` template is a solid starting point for our projects.

## What If You Already Committed Something You Shouldn't Have?

If you already committed a file and then add it to `.gitignore`, Git will keep tracking it. The `.gitignore` only prevents *new* files from being tracked. To stop tracking a file that is already committed:

```bash
# Stop tracking the file but keep it on your computer
git rm --cached .env

# Now commit the removal
git commit -m "Remove: Stop tracking .env file"
```

The `--cached` flag is important -- it removes the file from Git without deleting it from your computer.

<ProgressChecklist id="gitignore" items={[
  "I understand why .gitignore exists",
  "I know to never commit .env files",
  "I can create a .gitignore for a Node.js project",
