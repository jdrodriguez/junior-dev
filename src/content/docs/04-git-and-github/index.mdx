Git is the tool that tracks every single change you make to your code. GitHub is the website where your code lives online so you can share it, collaborate, and never lose it. Together, they are the backbone of professional software development.

Every developer on the planet uses Git. Every single one. It does not matter if you are building a side project alone in your room or working on a team of 500 engineers at Google -- Git is the system everyone agrees on.

<Analogy title="Git Is Your Code's Time Machine">
Imagine if every time you wrote an essay, you could save a snapshot of the entire document at any point. Made a mess of paragraph three? Jump back to the version from an hour ago. Want to try a completely different ending without losing what you already have? Create a parallel copy, experiment freely, and merge the good parts back in later. That is exactly what Git does for your code.

<DadTip>
Learning Git will feel weird at first. The commands are not intuitive, and you will mess things up. That is completely normal. I have been using Git for years and I still Google commands sometimes. The difference between a beginner and a pro is not that pros never make mistakes -- it is that they know how to recover from them. This chapter will teach you both.
