Before you write a single line of code, you need to set up your workstation. This chapter is about getting the right tools installed and configured so that everything else in this guide goes smoothly.

<Analogy title="The Carpenter's Workshop">
Imagine a carpenter about to build a bookshelf. Before they cut a single piece of wood, they organize their workshop. They make sure the table saw is set up, the drill bits are sorted, the measuring tape is within reach, and the workbench is clear. A messy workshop means mistakes, frustration, and wasted time. A clean one means you can focus entirely on the craft. Your development environment is your workshop. Let's set it up right.
</Analogy>

## What We're Setting Up

Here's every tool you'll install in this chapter, and what it does:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="VS Code" icon="laptop">
    Your code editor -- the main place where you'll read, write, and navigate code. Think of it as your workbench.
  </Card>
  <Card title="The Terminal" icon="open-book">
    A text-based way to control your computer. Instead of clicking through menus, you type commands. It's faster and more powerful.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Node.js & npm" icon="seti:javascript">
    The engine that runs JavaScript outside a browser, plus a package manager that lets you install thousands of pre-built code libraries.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Git" icon="github">
    Version control -- it tracks every change you make to your code so you can go back in time if something breaks.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Claude Code" icon="star">
    Your AI pair programmer. It lives in the terminal and can help you write code, debug problems, and build features from natural language.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## How Long Will This Take?

Plan for about **45 minutes to an hour**. Some of these installations require downloads, so your internet speed will be a factor. Don't rush it -- getting your environment right now prevents a lot of headaches later.

<DadTip>
If something goes wrong during installation (and it might -- every computer is a little different), don't panic. Copy the error message and ask Claude Code or paste it into Google. Installation issues are one of the most common things developers deal with, and the fix is almost always a quick search away.

## Let's Get Started

Work through each section in order. By the end of this chapter, your computer will be a fully equipped development machine.
