Every time you open a website, two computers are having a conversation. Your computer asks a question. Another computer answers it. That is the entire internet in one sentence.

## The Restaurant Analogy

<Analogy title="The Web Is a Restaurant">
Imagine you are sitting in a restaurant.

- **You** are the **client**. You look at the menu, decide what you want, and place an order.
- **The kitchen** is the **server**. It receives your order, prepares the food, and sends it back out.
- **The waiter** is **HTTP** -- the protocol that carries your request to the kitchen and brings the response back to your table.

You never walk into the kitchen yourself. You never shout your order across the room. There is a system. The waiter takes your order (the *request*), delivers it to the kitchen, and comes back with your plate (the *response*).

That is exactly how the web works. Your browser is you at the table. The server is the kitchen. And HTTP is the waiter carrying messages back and forth.
</Analogy>

## How It Actually Works

When you type `google.com` into your browser and press Enter, here is what happens:

1. **Your browser (the client)** creates a request: "Hey, I want the Google homepage."
2. **That request travels across the internet** to one of Google's servers -- a powerful computer sitting in a data center somewhere.
3. **The server processes the request** and builds a response: the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that make up the Google homepage.
4. **The response travels back** to your browser.
5. **Your browser renders it** -- turning that code into the visual page you see on screen.

This round trip happens every single time you click a link, submit a form, or load new data. It is called the **request-response cycle**, and it is the heartbeat of every web application.

## Frontend and Backend

When you build a full-stack application, you are building both sides of this conversation:

- **The frontend** is everything the user sees and interacts with -- buttons, forms, pages, animations. This runs in the browser (the client).
- **The backend** is the behind-the-scenes logic -- handling requests, talking to the database, running business rules. This runs on the server.

In our stack, React and Next.js handle the frontend. Hono and Supabase handle the backend. But they all communicate through this same request-response pattern.

<DadTip>
Here is a good way to remember it: if you can see it on screen, it is frontend. If it is happening behind the scenes, it is backend. When you tell Claude Code to "build a form that saves to the database," you are asking it to build both sides -- the form the user sees (frontend) and the logic that stores the data (backend).

## What to Tell Claude Code

<PromptExample
  prompt="Explain what happens step by step when a user visits my Next.js app in the browser."
  context="You want to understand the request-response cycle in your own project."
  result="Claude Code walks you through how Next.js handles the request on the server, renders the page, and sends it to the browser."
