Before you build anything on the web, you need to understand what the web *is*. Not at a deep technical level -- just enough to have a mental picture of what happens when someone types a URL into their browser and hits Enter.

This chapter gives you that mental picture.

## What You Will Learn

Every time you visit a website, a quiet conversation is happening between your computer and another computer somewhere in the world. Your browser asks for something. A server responds. That cycle -- request and response -- is the foundation of everything we build.

In this chapter, we will cover:

- **Client-Server Model** -- The two sides of every web conversation
- **HTTP** -- The language browsers and servers speak
- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** -- The three building blocks of every web page
- **JSON** -- How data gets packaged and shipped between systems
- **APIs** -- How different pieces of software connect and talk to each other

<DadTip>
You do not need to memorize any of this. The goal is to build an intuition. When you hear terms like "API" or "HTTP request" later, you want a picture in your head -- not a textbook definition. That intuition is what separates someone who can vibe code effectively from someone who is just guessing.

## Why This Matters for Vibe Coding

When you are working with Claude Code, you will constantly be asking it to "fetch data from the API" or "send a POST request" or "display this JSON." If you have no idea what those words mean, Claude Code's responses will feel like magic -- and when magic breaks, you have no way to fix it.

Understanding these fundamentals turns magic into machinery. And machinery you can debug.

Let's start with the basics.
