JavaScript is the language of the web. Every browser on Earth speaks it. Every website you have ever used runs it. And when you build full-stack applications, you will use it on both the frontend and the backend.

TypeScript is JavaScript with superpowers -- specifically, the ability to define *types* that catch mistakes before your code ever runs. Think of it as spell-check for your code. Our entire stack uses TypeScript, so this chapter covers both.

## What You Will Learn

- **JavaScript Foundations** -- Variables, functions, arrays, and the core concepts you need to read and understand code
- **TypeScript** -- What types are, why they matter, and why you should let TypeScript do most of the work
- **Async/Await** -- How JavaScript handles things that take time, like fetching data from an API

## A Different Kind of Learning

Here is the thing: you do not need to memorize syntax. You are not going to sit down and hand-write a sorting algorithm from memory. That is not how modern development works, and it is definitely not how vibe coding works.

What you *do* need is to understand the **concepts**. When you know what a function is, what an array does, and why async/await exists, you can describe what you want to Claude Code in plain English -- and actually understand what it writes back.

Think of this chapter like learning the rules of basketball. You do not need to memorize every play in the playbook before stepping on the court. But you need to know what dribbling is, what a pass is, and what the three-point line means. The plays come with practice. The concepts come first.

That is what this chapter is about. Concepts, mental models, and just enough vocabulary to have a real conversation with your AI pair programmer.

Let's get into it.
