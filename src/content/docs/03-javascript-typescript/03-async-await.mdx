Some things in programming happen instantly. Adding two numbers? Done. Checking if a string is empty? Done. But some things take time: fetching data from a server, reading a file, waiting for a user to upload an image. These are called **asynchronous** operations.

JavaScript has a clean way to handle them: **async/await**.

## The Food Delivery Analogy

<Analogy title="Async/Await Is Like Ordering Food Delivery">
Imagine you order dinner through a delivery app. You do not stand at the door and stare at it until the food arrives. That would be insane. Instead, you:

1. **Place the order** (start the asynchronous operation).
2. **Go do other things** -- watch TV, do homework, play a game (JavaScript keeps running other code).
3. **Get notified when it arrives** (the operation completes and you get the result).

That is async/await in a nutshell.

- **`async`** marks a function as one that will involve waiting. It is like saying: "This recipe includes a delivery order, so do not expect it to finish instantly."
- **`await`** is the actual waiting. It says: "Pause here until the delivery arrives, then continue with the next step."

Without `await`, JavaScript would just keep going and try to eat dinner before the food shows up. With `await`, it pauses that particular task and picks it up when the data is ready -- while still handling other things in the meantime.
</Analogy>

## Why This Matters for Web Development

Almost everything interesting in a web app involves waiting:

- **Fetching data from your API** -- Your frontend asks the backend for a list of tasks. The backend has to talk to the database, package the response, and send it back. That takes time.
- **Saving data to the database** -- The user fills out a form and clicks submit. The app needs to send that data to the server and wait for confirmation.
- **Loading an image** -- The browser downloads an image from a URL. How long that takes depends on the file size and the user's internet speed.
- **Authenticating a user** -- Checking login credentials with an auth service is an asynchronous call.

Every single one of these uses async/await. You will see this pattern hundreds of times.

## The Safety Net: try/catch

<Analogy title="try/catch Is a Safety Net">
What happens if the delivery never shows up? Maybe the restaurant is closed. Maybe there was a network error. You need a plan for when things go wrong.

That is what **try/catch** does. It wraps your async code in a safety net:

- **`try`** -- "Attempt to do this thing."
- **`catch`** -- "If it fails, here is what to do instead."

It is like saying: "Try to order dinner. If the delivery fails, order pizza instead." Without try/catch, a failed API call could crash your entire app. With it, you can show the user a friendly error message, retry the operation, or fall back to cached data.
</Analogy>

The pattern looks like this in plain English:

1. **Try** to fetch data from the API.
2. If it **works**, use the data.
3. If it **fails** (catch), show an error message to the user.

You will use this try/catch pattern with almost every async operation. It is not optional -- it is how professional apps handle the reality that things sometimes break.

<DadTip>
When you are working with Claude Code and you ask it to fetch data or save something to the database, check that it wraps the code in try/catch. If it does not, ask it to add error handling. This is one of those habits that separates code that works in demos from code that works in the real world.
</DadTip>

## The Key Insight

Here is the single most important thing to remember about async/await:

**`await` pauses execution until the asynchronous operation completes.**

That is it. When you see `await fetch(...)`, it means "wait here until the server responds, then continue to the next line." When you see `await supabase.from('tasks').select('*')`, it means "wait here until the database returns the data."

You do not need to understand the entire event loop or JavaScript's concurrency model. You need to know that `await` means "wait for this" and `try/catch` means "handle failures gracefully." With those two concepts, you can read and understand any async code Claude Code generates.

This is one of the best explanations of async/await on the internet. Fireship breaks down the concept visually and builds up from callbacks to promises to async/await. If you watch one video in this entire chapter, make it this one.

## What to Tell Claude Code

<PromptExample
  prompt="Write an async function that fetches all tasks from /api/tasks and handles errors with try/catch. If the request fails, log the error and return an empty array."
  context="You need a reusable function for fetching tasks with proper error handling."
  result="Claude Code writes an async function with await, try/catch, error logging, and a fallback return value."
/>

<PromptExample
  prompt="My app crashes when the API is slow or unreachable. Add error handling to my data fetching functions."
  context="Your app works when everything is fast, but breaks when the network is flaky."
  result="Claude Code wraps your fetch calls in try/catch blocks and adds loading states and error messages for the user."
