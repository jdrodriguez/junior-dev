You do not need to memorize JavaScript syntax. What you need is a mental model for the core concepts so you can read code that Claude Code generates and understand *what* it is doing and *why*. Here are the building blocks.

## Variables: Labeled Boxes

<Analogy title="Variables Are Labeled Boxes">
Imagine a shelf full of boxes. Each box has a label on it and something inside. That is a variable. The label is the name. The thing inside is the value.

- `const userName = "Jordan"` -- a box labeled "userName" with "Jordan" inside. The `const` means this box is sealed shut. You cannot swap what is inside.
- `let score = 0` -- a box labeled "score" with 0 inside. The `let` means this box can be opened and the value changed later. Maybe the score goes up to 10.

You will almost always use `const`. Only use `let` when you know the value needs to change. And never use `var` -- it is the old way and has quirks that cause bugs.
</Analogy>

## Data Types: What Goes in the Boxes

JavaScript has a few fundamental types of values:

- **Strings** -- Text. Anything in quotes: `"hello"`, `"Jordan Rodriguez"`, `"🏀"`.
- **Numbers** -- Any number: `42`, `3.14`, `-7`.
- **Booleans** -- True or false. That is it. `true` or `false`. Like a light switch: on or off.
- **Null** -- Intentionally empty. You looked in the box and it was deliberately left blank.
- **Undefined** -- Not yet assigned. The box exists but nobody put anything in it.
- **Arrays** -- Ordered lists of things. Like a numbered to-do list.
- **Objects** -- Groups of related data. Like a contact card with a name, email, and phone number.

You do not need to declare types in plain JavaScript (that is TypeScript's job). But you do need to recognize these when you see them in code.

## Functions: Recipes

<Analogy title="Functions Are Recipes">
A function is a recipe. It has a name, takes in ingredients (called *parameters*), follows a set of instructions, and produces a result (called a *return value*).

Think of a function called `makeSmoothie`. You give it bananas, strawberries, and milk (the parameters). It blends them together (the instructions). And it hands you back a smoothie (the return value).

Once you write the recipe, you can use it over and over with different ingredients. That is the power of functions -- write once, reuse everywhere.
</Analogy>

In modern JavaScript, functions look like this: `const makeSmoothie = (fruit, liquid) => { ... }`. That arrow (`=>`) is why they are called "arrow functions." You will see them everywhere.

The key ideas to remember:
- Functions take **inputs** (parameters) and produce **outputs** (return values).
- Functions let you **reuse** logic instead of repeating yourself.
- Functions can call other functions, which is how complex programs are built from simple pieces.

## Arrays: Ordered Lists

<Analogy title="Arrays Are Numbered Lists">
An array is like a numbered to-do list. Each item has a position (starting from 0, not 1), and you can add, remove, or transform items.

The most common things you will do with arrays:
- **Map** -- Transform every item. "Take my list of names and turn each one into a greeting card."
- **Filter** -- Keep only the items that pass a test. "Show me only the completed tasks."
- **Find** -- Get the first item that matches. "Find the user named Jordan."

These three operations -- map, filter, find -- show up in almost every web application. When Claude Code generates a list of cards on a page, it is almost certainly using `.map()`. When it adds a search feature, it is probably using `.filter()`.
</Analogy>

## Objects: Contact Cards

An object groups related data together under one name. Instead of having separate variables for a person's name, age, and email, you bundle them into one object:

Think of it as a contact card. The card is the object. Each field on the card (name, email, phone) is a **property**. You can read any property by name, update it, or add new ones.

Objects and arrays are the two structures you will see most. A list of users? That is an array of objects. A single user's profile? That is an object.

<DadTip>
When you are reading code Claude Code writes, you will see a lot of objects and arrays working together. Something like "an array of task objects, where each task has a title, status, and due date." Once you can picture that in your head, you can understand 90% of the data flowing through any web app.

## Watch This

## What to Tell Claude Code

<PromptExample
  prompt="Write a function that takes an array of tasks and returns only the ones that are not completed."
  context="You are building a task manager and need to filter the task list."
  result="Claude Code writes a function using .filter() that checks each task's completed status."
/>

<PromptExample
  prompt="Explain what .map(), .filter(), and .find() do on arrays. Give me one simple example of each."
  context="You want a quick refresher on the most common array methods."
  result="Claude Code explains each method with a clear, simple example."
/>

<ProgressChecklist
  id="ch3-js-foundations"
  items={[
    "I can explain what a variable is (labeled box)",
    "I know the difference between const and let",
    "I can explain what a function does (recipe with inputs and outputs)",
    "I understand arrays as ordered lists and objects as contact cards",
    "I know what .map(), .filter(), and .find() do conceptually",
    "I watched the JavaScript in 100 Seconds video"
  ]}
/>
