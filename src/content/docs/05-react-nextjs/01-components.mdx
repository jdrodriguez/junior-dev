A component is a reusable piece of user interface. That's it. That's the big idea. Everything you see in a React app -- every button, every card, every navigation bar, every entire page -- is a component.

<Analogy title="LEGO Bricks That Snap Together">
Think of a LEGO set. You have tiny pieces (a single 2x2 brick), medium pieces (a window frame), and large assemblies (an entire wall). In React, a **button** is a small component. A **user profile card** is a medium component that contains smaller ones (an image, a name, a bio). A **whole page** is a large component that snaps together many medium and small components. You build complex UIs the same way you build complex LEGO structures -- by combining simple, reusable pieces.
</Analogy>

## What Does a Component Look Like?

A React component is just a function that returns some HTML-like code. Here's the simplest possible example:

```tsx
function Greeting({ name }: { name: string }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
      <p>Welcome to our app.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

That's a component. It's a function called `Greeting` that takes a `name` and returns some UI. The HTML-looking stuff inside the return is called **JSX** -- it's a syntax that lets you write UI structure right alongside your logic. The curly braces `{name}` let you embed JavaScript values inside the JSX.

You don't need to memorize this syntax. What matters is understanding the concept: **a component is a function that describes a piece of UI.**

## Components Inside Components

Here's where it gets powerful. Components can contain other components. A `ProfilePage` component might contain a `Header` component, a `ProfileCard` component, and a `PostList` component. The `PostList` might contain many `PostCard` components. Each piece is independent and reusable.

<DiagramBlock src="/images/diagrams/react-component-tree.svg" alt="A tree diagram showing an App component at the top, branching into Header, Main Content, and Footer components, with further sub-components beneath each" caption="A React component tree -- the App is made of smaller components, which are made of even smaller components." />

This tree-like structure is how every React app is organized. The top of the tree is usually your `App` or page component, and it branches down into smaller and more specific pieces.

## Why Components Matter

Without components, building a web app would mean writing one massive file of tangled HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Every website built in the early 2000s worked this way, and it was a nightmare to maintain. You'd fix something in one place and accidentally break something in another.

With components, you get:

- **Reusability** -- Build a `Button` once, use it everywhere. Need to change how buttons look across your entire app? Change it in one place.
- **Organization** -- Each piece of UI lives in its own file. Easy to find, easy to fix. When your app grows to dozens of pages, this matters a lot.
- **Isolation** -- If something breaks in the `ProfileCard`, it doesn't affect the `Header`. Each component is its own little world.
- **Testability** -- You can test each component independently to make sure it works correctly.

<DadTip>
Here's a rule of thumb I use at work: if a piece of UI shows up in more than one place, it should be a component. And if a component gets longer than about 200-300 lines, it's time to split it into smaller components. Keep things small and focused.
</DadTip>

## How You'll Actually Build Components

In practice, you won't be hand-writing components from scratch most of the time. You'll describe what you want to Claude Code, and it will generate the component for you. But because you understand what a component is, you'll be able to review what it gives you and know whether it makes sense.

<PromptExample prompt="Create a React component for a user profile card that shows an avatar image, the user's name, their email, and a short bio. Use TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for styling." context="When you need a new piece of UI for your app" result="Claude Code generates a ProfileCard component with proper TypeScript types, Tailwind styling, and clean structure" />

Notice how the prompt describes *what* the component should show, not *how* to code it. That's the sweet spot. You bring the design thinking ("what should this card contain?"), and Claude Code handles the implementation.

## Real-World Example: Breaking Down a Page

Open any app you use daily -- say, a social media feed. Look at it and try to spot the components:

- The **navigation bar** at the top? That's a component.
- Each **post** in the feed? That's a component, probably containing sub-components for the avatar, the text content, the like button, and the comment section.
- The **sidebar** with suggested follows? That's a component containing a list of smaller **user card** components.
- The **compose box** where you type a new post? Another component.

This is how React developers think. They look at a design and mentally draw boxes around the pieces. Each box is a component. When you start seeing the world this way, you're thinking like a frontend developer.

## The Key Takeaway

Everything in React is a component. Components are functions that return UI. You build complex interfaces by combining simple components. That mental model is the foundation for everything else in this chapter.
